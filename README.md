# Mix Master: Getting Started

Welcome to Mix Master! An app where we keep track of songs, artists, and playlists. Maybe we'll even add in some user ownership. Who knows! It will be an adventure. 

### Main Goals

* deploy an app to Heroku
* write model tests using RSpec
* write feature tests using RSpec and Capybara
* use branches and commits to develop git workflow
* model one-to-many data relationships
* model many-to-many data relationships
* use factories to create objects to use in tests
* use partials and helpers to tidy up views
* model one-to-one data relationships
* use polymorphic associations to associate an object with one of several other models
* implement authentication using Twitter OAuth
* write controller and view specs
