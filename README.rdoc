# Mix Master: Getting Started

Welcome to Mix Master! We'll create an app where we keep track of songs, artists, and playlists. Maybe we'll even add in some user ownership. Who knows! It will be an adventure. 

### Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will know/be able to:

* deploy an app to Heroku
* write model tests using RSpec
* write feature tests using RSpec and Capybara
* use branches and commits to develop git workflow
* model one-to-many data relationships
* model many-to-many data relationships
* use factories to create objects to use in tests

Depending on if/when the rest of the tutorial gets written, you may also know/be able to:

* use partials and helpers to tidy up views
* model one-to-one data relationships
* use polymorphic associations to associate an object with one of several other models
* implement authentication using Twitter OAuth
* write controller and view specs

### Getting Started

Check that you have Rails installed. From your terminal, type:

```
$ rails -v
Rails 4.2.6
```

This tutorial is written using Rails 4.2.6, but it should be applicable to any similar version.

Create a new Rails project:

```
$ rails new mix_master -d postgresql --skip-test-unit --skip-turbolinks --skip-spring
```

What do these things do?

* `-d postgresql` will give us a Rails project that already has Postgresql configured
* `--skip-test-unit` will tell rails to **not** generate the `test` directory and the default Test::Unit framework
* `--skip-turbolinks` and `--skip-spring` will generate a project without turbolinks and spring, both of which can cause some annoying behavior

### Using RSpec instead of Test::Unit

So far, we've done a lot with Minitest and Test::Unit since that's what Rails uses by default. However, we're going to use [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) for this tutorial. You should be comfortable with both frameworks. There are a few steps we'll take to use RSpec in our project.

1) Add RSpec as a dependency in the Gemfile. The `group :development, :test...` probably already exists in the Gemfile. You'll just need to add `gem 'rspec-rails'`.

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end
```

2) Install this dependency:

```
$ bundle install
```

(`install` is the default for Bundler, so `bundle install` and `bundle` will get you the same behavior)

3) Run the generator to create initial RSpec setup:

```
$ rails generate rspec:install
      create  .rspec
      create  spec
      create  spec/spec_helper.rb
      create  spec/rails_helper.rb
```

This created a [`.rspec` file](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-0/docs/configuration/read-command-line-configuration-options-from-files), a [`spec` directory](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/directory-structure) (this is equivalent to the `test` directory if we were using Test::Unit), and [two helper files](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/upgrade).

### Using Unicorn instead of WEBrick

By default, Rails uses the Webrick server which is slow. Let's use Unicorn instead. In your Gemfile, uncomment this line:

```ruby
gem 'unicorn'
```

Then run `bundle`. To start up the server:

```
# Use Unicorn as the app server
$ unicorn
```

### Git Setup

Initialize your project as a Git repository:

```
$ git init
```

Then add and commit:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

### Shipping to Heroku

We want to host our Rails application on the internet using the popular [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) service.

If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to create a [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/www-header). After creating your account download and install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

Heroku requires applications to use a PostgresSQL database and not a Sqlite database. Good thing we generated our Rails project with a Postgres database! Some people may choose to use Sqlite locally when running in test and development and PostgresSQL only on Heroku. This configuration is indeed possible; however, it's important to remember that these databases have slightly different behaviors, so something that works with Sqlite may not work with Postgres, and vice versa.

Debugging in production on Heroku is difficult without error logging, so we'll add the [`rails_12factor`](https://github.com/heroku/rails_12factor) gem to our Gemfile:

```
gem 'rails_12factor', group: :production
```

From the documentation: "This gem enables serving assets in production and setting your logger to standard out, both of which are required to run a Rails 4 application on a twelve-factor provider." Before you continue, I recommend reading the "Rails 4 Logging" and "Rails 4 Serve Static Assets" sections of the [`rails_12factor README`](https://github.com/heroku/rails_12factor) so that you can get a better understanding of exactly what this gem provides. 


Remember to `bundle`.

Now, let's ship to Heroku! This next command will only work if you installed the Heroku Toolbelt.

```
$ heroku create
Creating adjective-noun-number... done, stack is cedar-14
https://adjective-noun-number.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/adjective-noun-number.git
Git remote heroku added
```

The toolbelt will ask for your username and password the first time you run the create, but after that you’ll be using an SSH key for authentication.

After running the create command, you’ll get back the URL where the app is accessible. Try loading the URL in your browser and you’ll see the generic Heroku splash screen. This is because we haven't actually pushed our code to Heroku. All we did was create the remote.

Now push to Heroku:

```
$ git push heroku master
...
...lots and lots of output
...
remote: -----> Launching... done, v5
remote:        https://adjective-noun-number.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
```

Now navigate to your Heroku URL and **you should see an error**:

```
The page you were looking for doesn't exist.

You may have mistyped the address or the page may have moved.

If you are the application owner check the logs for more information.
```

Don't worry! Everything is fine. The reason we see this is because we haven't written any code yet.
